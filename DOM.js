// // //DOM stands for Document Object Model
// // The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.


// The Document Object Model (DOM) is essential in web development for several reasons:

// Dynamic Web Pages: It allows you to create dynamic web pages. It enables the JavaScript to access and manipulate page content, structure, and style dynamically which gives interactive and responsive web experiences, such as updating content without reloading the entire page or responding to user actions instantly.
// Interactivity: With the DOM, you can respond to user actions (like clicks, inputs, or scrolls) and modify the web page accordingly.
// Content Updates: When you want to update the content without refreshing the entire page, the DOM enables targeted changes making the web applications more efficient and user-friendly.
// Cross-Browser Compatibility: Different browsers may render HTML and CSS in different ways. The DOM provides a standardized way to interact with page elements.
// Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Applications built with frameworks such as React or Angular, heavily rely on the DOM for efficient rendering and updating of content within a single HTML page without reloading the full page.


// **********************************************
